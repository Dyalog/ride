**Option 2:** Download and install the
[latest release](https://github.com/Dyalog/ride/releases/latest) from this
repository.

**Option 3:** Build RIDE from source:

install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [NodeJS v10.13.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v10.13.0/)

    git clone https://github.com/dyalog/ride --depth=1
    cd ride
    npm i         # download dependencies
    npm start     # start RIDE (without building native apps)
    node mk dist  # build native apps under _/ride${version}/
    node mk c     # cleans your build directory
