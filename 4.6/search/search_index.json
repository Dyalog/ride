With it, you can use APL interactively to explore data, discover algorithms and create solutions \u2013 or diagnose problems, resolve issues and resume the execution of running applications.</p> <p>Ride runs separately from the APL interpreter, but can communicate with any local or remote APL session. It can launch APL sessions on remote machines or to connect to APL interpreters that are already running.</p> <p>An interpreter can also provide Ride's interface as a web page. This makes it possible to control a remote interpreter thorugh a browser, without installing Ride on your machine. For this zero-footprint mode to work on Windows, Ride needs to be installed on the machine where the interpreter is running, however, it comes with the interpreter installation on all other platforms.</p> <p>On Windows, the interpreter has a built-in IDE, which continues to provide the richest environment, however, Ride is the recommended interface on all other platforms.</p>"},{"location":"keyboard_shortcuts/","title":"Keyboard Shortcuts","text":"<p>The Dyalog keyboard shortcuts that are supported by the Ride are listed below; those that can be configured in the Shortcuts tab of the Preferences dialog box are indicated with a * character.</p> Code Command Default Keystrokes Description ABT* About Shift + F1 Display the About dialog box AC* Align comments Edit : Align comments to current column AO* Comment out lines Session/Edit : Add comment symbol at start of each tagged or current line BH* Run to exit (in tracer) Trace : Continue execution from the current line to completion of the current function or operator.
