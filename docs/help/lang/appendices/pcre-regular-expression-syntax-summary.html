NAME
       PCRE - Perl-compatible regular expressions


PCRE REGULAR EXPRESSION SYNTAX SUMMARY

       The  full syntax and semantics of the regular expressions that are sup-
       ported by PCRE are described in  the  pcrepattern  documentation.  This
       document contains just a quick-reference summary of the syntax.


QUOTING

         \x         where x is non-alphanumeric is a literal x
         \Q...\E    treat enclosed characters as literal


CHARACTERS

         \a         alarm, that is, the BEL character (hex 07)
         \cx        "control-x", where x is any ASCII character
         \e         escape (hex 1B)
         \f         formfeed (hex 0C)
         \n         newline (hex 0A)
         \r         carriage return (hex 0D)
         \t         tab (hex 09)
         \ddd       character with octal code ddd, or backreference
         \xhh       character with hex code hh
         \x{hhh..}  character with hex code hhh..


CHARACTER TYPES

         .          any character except newline;
                      in dotall mode, any character whatsoever
         \C         one byte, even in UTF-8 mode (best avoided)
         \d         a decimal digit
         \D         a character that is not a decimal digit
         \h         a horizontal whitespace character
         \H         a character that is not a horizontal whitespace character
         \N         a character that is not a newline
         \p{xx}     a character with the xx property
         \P{xx}     a character without the xx property
         \R         a newline sequence
         \s         a whitespace character
         \S         a character that is not a whitespace character
         \v         a vertical whitespace character
         \V         a character that is not a vertical whitespace character
         \w         a "word" character
         \W         a "non-word" character
         \X         an extended Unicode sequence

       In  PCRE,  by  default, \d, \D, \s, \S, \w, and \W recognize only ASCII
       characters, even in UTF-8 mode. However, this can be changed by setting
       the PCRE_UCP option.

CHARACTER CLASSES

         [...]       positive character class
         [^...]      negative character class
         [x-y]       range (can be used for hex characters)
         [[:xxx:]]   positive POSIX named set
         [[:^xxx:]]  negative POSIX named set

         alnum       alphanumeric
         alpha       alphabetic
         ascii       0-127
         blank       space or tab
         cntrl       control character
         digit       decimal digit
         graph       printing, excluding space
         lower       lower case letter
         print       printing, including space
         punct       printing, excluding alphanumeric
         space       whitespace
         upper       upper case letter
         word        same as \w
         xdigit      hexadecimal digit

       In PCRE, POSIX character set names recognize only ASCII  characters  by
       default,  but  some  of them use Unicode properties if PCRE_UCP is set.
       You can use \Q...\E inside a character class.

         (?P=name)       reference by name (Python)


SUBROUTINE REFERENCES (POSSIBLY RECURSIVE)

         (?R)            recurse whole pattern
         (?n)            call subpattern by absolute number
         (?+n)           call subpattern by relative number
         (?-n)           call subpattern by relative number

         (?(condition)yes-pattern)
         (?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)

         (?(n)...        absolute reference condition
         (?(+n)...       relative reference condition
         (?(-n)...       relative reference condition
         (?(&lt;name&gt;)...   named reference condition (Perl)

         (?(DEFINE)...   define subpattern for reference
         (?(assert)...   assertion condition


BACKTRACKING CONTROL

       The following act immediately they are reached:

         (*ACCEPT)       force successful match
         (*FAIL)         force backtrack; synonym (*F)

       The  following  act only when a subsequent match failure causes a back-
       track to reach them. They all force a match failure, but they differ in
       what happens afterwards. Those that advance the start-of-match point do
       so only if the pattern is not anchored.

         (*COMMIT)       overall failure, no advance of starting point
         (*PRUNE)        advance to next starting character
         (*SKIP)         advance start to current matching position
         (*THEN)         local failure, backtrack to next alternation


NEWLINE CONVENTIONS

       These are recognized only at the very start of the pattern or  after  a
       (*BSR_...) or (*UTF8) or (*UCP) option.

         (*CR)           carriage return only
         (*LF)           linefeed only
         (*CRLF)         carriage return followed by linefeed
         (*ANYCRLF)      all three of the above
         (*ANY)          any Unicode newline sequence


WHAT \R MATCHES

       These  are  recognized only at the very start of the pattern or after a
       (*...) option that sets the newline convention or UTF-8 or UCP mode.

         (*BSR_ANYCRLF)  CR, LF, or CRLF
         (*BSR_UNICODE)  any Unicode newline sequence


CALLOUTS

         (?C)      callout
         (?Cn)     callout with data n
