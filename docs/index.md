# About This Document

This document introduces the Remote Integrated Development Environment (RIDE). It describes the installation process and RIDE's user interface (windows, menus, customisation options, keycode/keystroke mappings, etc.).

RIDE can be extensively customised; this document assumes that the default configuration is in use.

## Audience

It is assumed that the reader has a working knowledge of Dyalog.

The Dyalog website contains a range of [resources](https://www.dyalog.com/introduction.htm) to helo you develop your knowledge. New users might also find that it is helpful to select the Show tips for glyphs check box in the [General tab](general_tab.md) of the Preferences dialog box.

## Conventions

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all examples in Dyalog documentation assume that `⎕IO` and `⎕ML` are both 1.

Various icons are used in this document to emphasise specific material.
General note icons, and the type of material that they are used to emphasise, include:

|Symbol | Meaning |
|----   | ----    |
|![hint](img/screenshots/hint_note.svg) | Hints, tips, best practice and recommendations from Dyalog Ltd.|
|![info](img/screenshots/information_note.svg)| Information note highlighting material of particular significance or relevance.|
|![legacy](img/screenshots/legacy_note.svg)|Legacy information pertaining to behaviour in earlier releases of Dyalog or to functionality that still exists but has been superseded and is no longer recommended.|
|![warning](img/screenshots/warning_note.svg)|Warnings about actions that can impact the behaviour of Dyalog or have unforeseen consequences.|

Although the Dyalog programming language is identical on all platforms, differences do exist in the way some functionality is implemented and in the tools and interfaces that are available. Dyalog publishes a [full list](https://www.dyalog.com/dyalog/current-platforms.htm) of the platforms on which Dyalog is supported. Within this document, differences in behaviour between operating systems are identified with the following icons (representing macOS, Linux, UNIX and Microsoft Windows respectively)
