# About This Document

This document introduces the Remote Integrated Development Environment (Ride). It describes the installation process and Ride's user interface (windows, menus, customisation options, keycode/keystroke mappings, etc.).

Ride can be extensively customised; this document assumes that the default configuration is in use.

## Audience

It is assumed that the reader has a working knowledge of Dyalog.

The Dyalog website contains a range of [resources](https://www.dyalog.com/introduction.htm) to help you develop your knowledge. New users might also find that it is helpful to select the Show tips for glyphs check box in the [General tab](customising_your_session.md/#general-tab) of the **Preferences** dialog box.

## Conventions

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all examples in Dyalog documentation assume that `⎕IO` and `⎕ML` are both 1.

!!!note
    Warnings about actions that can impact the behaviour of Dyalog or have unforeseen consequences are shown in boxes like this one.
